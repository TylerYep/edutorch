        Forward pass for layer normalization.

        During both training and test-time, the incoming data is normalized per data-point,
        before being scaled by gamma and beta parameters identical to that of batch normalization.

        Note that in contrast to batch normalization, the behavior during train and test-time for
        layer normalization are identical, and we do not need to keep track of running averages
        of any sort.

        Uses transpose matrix transformations to reuse batch norm code.

        Input:
        - x: Data of shape (N, D)
        - gamma: Scale parameter of shape (D,)
        - beta: Shift paremeter of shape (D,)
        - ln_param: Dictionary with the following keys:
            - eps: Constant for numeric stability
